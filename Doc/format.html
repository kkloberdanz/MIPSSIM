Introduction
</H3>

   The MIPS R2000/R3000 ISA has fixed-width 32 bit instructions.
Fixed-width instructions are common for RISC processors because
they make it easy to fetch instructions without having to decode.
These instructions must be stored at word-aligned addresses (i.e.,
addresses divisible by 4).
<P>
   The MIPS ISA instructions fall into three categories:
R-type, I-type, and J-type.   Not all ISAs divide their instructions
this neatly.  This is one reason to study MIPS as a first assembly
language.  The format is simple.
<H3>
R-type
</H3>
  R-type instructions refer to register type instructions.  Of the
three formats, the R-type is the most complex.
<P>
  This is the format of the R-type instruction, when it is encoded
in machine code.

   The prototypical R-type instruction is:
<FONT size=+3>
<PRE>
add $rd, $rs, $rt
</PRE>
</FONT>
   where $rd refers to some register <B>d</B> (<B>d</B> is shown
as a variable, however, to use the instruction, you must put a
number between 0 and 31, inclusive for <B>d</B>). <B>$rs</B>, <B>$rt</B> are
also registers.
<P>
   The semantics of the instruction are;
<FONT size=+3>
<PRE>
R[d] = R[s] + R[t]
</PRE>
</FONT>
  where the addition is signed addition.
<P>
  You will notice that the order of the registers in the instruction
is the destination register (<B>$rd</B>), followed by the two source
registers (<B>$rs</B> and <B>$rt</B>).
<P>
  However, the actual binary format (shown in the table above)
stores the two source registers first, then the destination
register.  Thus, how the assembly language programmer uses the
instruction, and how the instruction is stored in binary, do not
always have to match.
<P>
   Let's explain each of the fields of the R-type instruction.
<P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI> <B>opcode</B> (B<sub>31-26</sub>)
<P>
  Opcode is short for "operation code".  The opcode is a binary
encoding for the instruction. Opcodes are seen in all ISAs.  In
MIPS, there is an opcode for <B>add</B>.  
<P>
  The opcode in MIPS ISA is only 6 bits.  Ordinarily, this means there
are only 64 possible instructions.  Even for a RISC ISA, which typically
has few instructions, 64 is quite small.  For <I>R-type</I> instructions,
an additional 6 bits are used (B<sub>5-0</sub>) called the <I>function</I>.
Thus, the 6 bits of the opcode and the 6 bits of the function specify
the kind of instruction for <I>R-type</I> instructions.
<P>
  <LI> <B>rd</B> (B<sub>25-21</sub>)
<P>
  This is the <I>destination register</I>.  The destination register
is the register where the result of the operation is stored.
<P>
  <LI> <B>rs</B> (B<sub>20-16</sub>)
<P>
  This is the first <I>source register</I>.  The source register
is the register that holds one of the arguments of the operation.
<P>
  <LI> <B>rt</B> (B<sub>15-11</sub>)
<P>
  This is the second <I>source register</I>. 
<P>
  <LI> <B>shift amount</B> (B<sub>10-6</sub>)
<P>
   The amount of bits to shift.  Used in shift instructions.
<P>
  <LI> <B>function</B> (B<sub>5-0</sub>)
<P>
   An additional 6 bits used to specify the operation, in
addition to the opcode.
</UL>

I-type instructions
</H3>
  I-type is short for "immediate type".  The format of an
I-type instuction looks like:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </B>
  </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
   The prototypical I-type instruction looks like:
<FONT size=+3>
<PRE>
add $rt, $rs, immed
</PRE>
</FONT>
  In this case, <B>$rt</B> is the destination register,
and <B>$rs</B> is the only source register.   It is unusual
that <B>$rd</B> is not used, and that <B>$rd</B> does not
appear in bit positions <B>B<sub>25-21</sub></B> for both
R-type and I-type instructions.  Presumably, the designers
of the MIPS ISA had their reasons for not making the destination
register at a particular location for R-type and I-type.
<P>
   The semantics of the <B>addi</B> instruction are;
<FONT size=+3>
<PRE>
R[t] = R[s] + (IR<sub>15</sub>)<sup>16</sup> IR<sub>15-0</sub>
</PRE>
</FONT>
  where IR refers to the instruction register, the register
where the current instruction is stored.  (IR<sub>15</sub>)<sup>16</sup>
means that bit <B>B<sub>15</sub></B> of the instruction register
(which is the sign bit of the immediate value) is repeated 16 times.
This is then followed by IR<sub>15-0</sub>, which is the 16 bits
of the immediate value.
<P>
   Basically, the semantics says to sign-extend the immediate value to
32 bits, add it (using signed addition) to register <B>R[s]</B>, and
store the result in register <B>$rt</B>.
<P>

<H3>
J-type instructions
</H3>
  J-type is short for "jump type".  The format of an
J-type instuction looks like:

</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
   The prototypical I-type instruction looks like:
<FONT size=+3>
<PRE>
j target
</PRE>
</FONT>
   The semantics of the <B>j</B> instruction (<B>j</B> means jump)
are:
<FONT size=+3>
<PRE>
PC <- PC<sub>31-28</sub> IR<sub>25-0</sub> 00
</PRE>
</FONT>
  where PC is the program counter, which stores the current
address of the instruction being executed.  You update
the PC by using the upper 4 bits of the program counter,
followed by the 26 bits of the target (which is the lower
26 bits of the instruction register), followed by two 0's,
which creates a 32 bit address.  The jump instruction will
be explained in more detail in a future set of notes.
<H3>
Why Five Bits?
</H3>
   If you look at the <B>R-type</B> and <B>I-type</B>
instructions, you will see 5 bits reserved for each
register.  You might wonder why.
<P>
   MIPS supports 32 integer registers.  To specify each
register, the register are identified with a number from 0 to
31.  It takes <B>log<sub>2</sub> 32 = 5</B> bits to specify
one of 32 registers.
<P>
   If MIPS has 64 register, you would need 6 bits to specify the
register.
<P>
   The register number is specified using unsigned binary.  Thus,
00000 refers to <B>$r0</B> and 11111 refers to register <B>$r31</B>.

<H3>
Why Study Instruction Formats
</H3>
   You might wonder why it's important to study instruction formats.
They seem to be arbitrarily constructed.  Yet, they aren't.  For
example, it's quite useful to have the opcode be the same size and
the same location.  It's useful to know the exact bits used for
the immediate value.  This makes decoding much quicker, and the
hardware to handle instruction decoding that much simpler.
<P>
   Furthermore, you begin to realize what information the instructions
store.  For example, it's not all that obvious that immediate values
are stored as part of the instruction for <B>I-type</I> instructions.
<P>
   If you know that, for example, <B>addi</B> does signed addition,
then you can also conclude that the immediate value is represented
in 2C.  Also, to add the immediate value to a 32-bit register value
would mean sign-extending the immediate value to 32 bits.
<P>
   However, not all I-type instructions encode the 16 bit
immediate in 2C.  For example, <B>addiu</B> (add immediate unsigned)
interprets the 16 bits as UB.  It zero-extends the immediate
and then adds it to the value stored in a 32 bit register.
<H3>
Three Operand Instructions
</H3>
   Also, notice that the <B>R-type</B> instructions use three
operands (i.e., arguments).  In earlier, pre-RISC ISAs, memory
was expensive, so ISA designers tried to minimize the number
of bits used in an instruction.  This meant that there were often
two, one, or no operands.   
<P>
   How did they manage that?  Here's an example of an instruction
<FONT size=+2>
<PRE>
cisc_add $r1, $r2  # R[1] = R[1] + R[2]
</PRE>
</FONT>
<P> 
  One way to reduce the total number of operands is to make one operand
both a source and a destination register.
<P>
   Another approach is to use an implicit register.
<FONT size=+2>
<PRE>
acc_add $r2  # Acc = Acc + R[2]
</PRE>
</FONT>
  For example, there may be a special register called the <I>accumulator</I>.
This register is not mentioned explicitly in the instruction.  Instead,
it is implied by the opcode.  
<P>
   Early personal computers such as the Apple 2, used ISAs with 1 or
2 registers, and those registers were often part of most instructions,
thus they didn't have to be specified.
<P>
   With memory becoming cheaper, and memory access becoming cheaper,
it's become easier to devote more bits to an instruction, and to specify
three operands instead of two.  This makes it more convenient for the
assembly language programmer.

<H3>
Summary
</H3>
   MIPS instructions fall into three categories: <B>R-type</B>,
<B>I-type</B>, and <B>J-type</B>.   You should know how the bits
are laid out (i.e., what the 6 parts of the R-type instruction
are, and how many bits in each of the 6 parts).  However, it's
unnecessary to memorize opcodes.
